In order to obtain these results I did the following:
1. Train the task to obtain the file: DCOACH_HM-True_e-0.3_B-10000_Eval-False_tau-0.0001_lr-0.003_HMlr-0.0003_task-kuka-park-cardboard_COMPLETE_rep-00
2. From the last episodes of the training, pick the one that seems to show the last best performance, in this case, the episode number 63
3. Perform the evaluations, evaluating every 5 episodes. For this task I did 5 evaluations
4. Take the file DCOACH_HM-True_e-0.3_B-10000_Eval-False_tau-0.0001_lr-0.003_HMlr-0.0003_task-kuka-park-cardboard_COMPLETE_rep-00 and manually remove the episodes that are not every 5 episodes. The result is the file: DCOACH_HM-True_e-0.3_B-10000_Eval-False_tau-0.0001_lr-0.003_HMlr-0.0003_task-kuka-park-cardboard_rep-00
5. Then, and in order to match the number of timesteps of the original training to the evaluations, I made 5 copies of the file DCOACH_HM-True_e-0.3_B-10000_Eval-False_tau-0.0001_lr-0.003_HMlr-0.0003_task-kuka-park-cardboard_rep-00 and I paste the results of the success of each evaluation in row 16, and I give them the names: DCOACH_HM-True_e-0.3_B-10000_Eval-True_tau-0.0001_lr-0.003_HMlr-0.0003_task-kuka-park-cardboard_rep-{}.csv
